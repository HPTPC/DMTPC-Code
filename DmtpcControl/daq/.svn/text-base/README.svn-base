The dmtpcDBdaemon script should be copied into
/etc/init.d/

If it is not yet added to chkconfig, then run (as root)

chkconfig --add dmtpcDBdaemon
chkconfig --level 2345 dmtpcDBdaemon on

Remember you might need to 'chmod +x dmtpcDBdaemon' if you just 
checked it out from svn

Then you can run

service dmtpcDBdaemon start|stop|restart|status

as a normal chkconfig script
