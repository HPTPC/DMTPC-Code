Code for analysing images taken of field cage to study field uniformity

<>field_uniformity: sum the images from source data. uses raw root files.

	 bin/field_uniformity list_of_files.txt savefile.root

list_of_files.txt includes the full path to the file

---Files---
darco_Cs_137_148kbq.root : new source data with stronger source. uses dmtpc_darc_{5..33}.root


---txt files---
not sure what clean means in the 'clean' txt file.

m3_690V.txt: skimmed m3 690V data, only cam 3 was at stable voltage.

m3_multi_V.txt: added runs at different voltages from list of good runs. runs that didn't pass data quality cuts are excluded (i.e. errant image means/rms)




output: 

>plot_pixel_intensity
	nomeansub - run on data that has been mean-subtracted
	>this level: cam3 runs
	      >cam2: cam2 runs for data and darkdata

>field_uniformity
	>this level: output for when run on multiple files
	      >noclust: output for _noclust1 version, run on single run (then hadd)
	      >this level: cam 3 data
	      	    >darkdata: cam 3 dark data
		    >cam2 : subfolder for data and dark data
