WARNING: THIS IS NOT THE VERSION OF CODE RUNNING ON THE COMPUTERS IN THE LAB. THE DMTPC-M3DAQ REPOSITORY HOSTS THE ACTUALLY USED CODE

This is the code from the DMTPC used for analysing data from the CCDs.

Inside ccd_characterisation, run_calc_rms.C calculates the camera noise for a run. The bias is subtracted
by averaging the bias frames and subtracting from each image. This code has been checked and works.
Run using: root -l run_calc_rms.C(run#)

rdRaw2Ped.C calculates the noise of a run, with the bias being calculated for each pixel, then each bias
is subtracted one by one. To run this the code needs to be compiled, then execute
root -l rdRaw2Ped.C’(<runId>,0,”<path_to_output_directory>",1)’
The location and name of the raw data files are hard coded, as well as the number of cameras enabled.
The output is a root file with the extension m3ped.root.
Inside these the histogram cam3_pedAvr contains the average pedestal (value) and rms (error) for each pixel.
cam3_pedStat contains the pedestal ‘status’ with a non-zero value for all bins for which the pedestal was not computed.
(the status of pedestals in the overscan are automatically assigned ‘1’)
Other reasons that a pedestal may have non-zero status are:
— pedestal spectrum has less than 90% of counts around pedestal
— pedestal RMS is below 5 ADU
They are basically pixels for which the pedestal could not be calculated. 
(We haven't used this code yet)

predicted_noise.C computes the noise given the camera specifications and compares this to the noise calculated from the
noise calculation code
