MCAmp is designed to simulate DMTPC amplification regions, although
it can probably be used more generally for e.g. drifting and stuff. 


It depends on: 

 -gmsh + included dmtpc_gmsh.patch (patch is against recent svn version e.g.  17317) 

 To apply the patch, cd into the gmsh directory and 

  patch -p0 < /path/to/dmtpc_gmsh.patch

  then compile as usual. 

 -elmerfem (calls ElmerGrid and ElmerSolver) 
 -garfieldpp (GARFIELD_HOME is expected to be defined appropriately) 
    apply the patch if you want conductors 
 -ROOT 


See the models directory for some examples.
