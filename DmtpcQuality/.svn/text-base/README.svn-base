Quality Framework
Author: Richard Eggleston Feb 2016

--Main Files--

MySQL(.hh/.cc): Class for accessing the MySQL database and returning values
SQLite(.hh/.cc): Class for accessing SQLite database files (reading and writing)
RunQuality(.hh/.cc): Class for assesing the quality of a run, event by event
		     quite simple at the moment but intended for expansion

--Main Executables--
To be run on m3daq:
extractDatabase: stores useful parameters from the MySQL databases to a SQLite file (currently only spark info)
To be run anywhere (transfer sqlite output from previous step!)
runChecker: uses RunQuality to provide easy user functionality to assess events (currently only if sparks)
